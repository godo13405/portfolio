## Pleased to meet you

I’m a User Experience Designer based in London, and I believe that Design is all about coming together to solve human problems.

I’ve been here for a few years now, but I’m originally from Portugal. This means my accent might change from British to Canadian or American at a moment’s notice, which is a lot of fun.

I enjoy reading comic books and playing Dungeons and Dragons, like the nerd I am. I am also almost always up for a pint and a chat down the pub.
