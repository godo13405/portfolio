[Inova+](https://goncaloandrade.com/client/inova/)A consultancy that helped other companies do projects for the European Union. This involved, amongst many other things, graphic design for all their communication materials. I helped Inova+ design logos and identities to use with these on several projects.

# Framework branding

This was a branding project for a european framework for project managers. The project came from the agency I was freelancing with at the time, [Inovamais](http://inovamais.eu/). They decided to contract me themselves to work on the identity of this product.
