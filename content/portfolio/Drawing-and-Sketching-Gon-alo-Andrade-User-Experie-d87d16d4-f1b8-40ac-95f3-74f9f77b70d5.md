## Mastering “pen & paper” sketching

While in university I took arts classes for 3 years. What I learned here was not only professional sketching, but also techniques to do with composition, perception psychology and observation.

Here is a selection of the best work I produced during that time. You can see a mix of techniques and types of illustrations and drawings.
